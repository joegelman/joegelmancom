        <p class="body"><strong class="opener">New product, bigger story. </strong>Expand the vision and story to fit a growing offering. Speak to a more senior, strategic champion. Do it in style. And in very few words. Because CMOs think big, and are crazy busy.</p>

        <h2 class="sect-title">The Strategy</h2>
        <p class="body"><strong class="opener">Unstoppable Journeys. </strong>Namogoo both stops malicious ads from luring customers away from your site, and generates custom promotions to keep them shopping. Adopting the guru personality, we sought to inspire with the story and tagline of “unstoppable journeys.”</p>

        <h2 class="sect-title">The Results</h2>
        <p class="body"><strong class="opener">Can't stop, won't stop. </strong>Namogoo loved their tagline so much, they already started using #unstoppable all over social before launch. But once they did launch, the story and slogan took off like crazy. It's become more than a strategy. It's a rallying cry. It's unstoppable.</p>

<h1>Save your work ðŸ’¾</h1>
<p>As we all learned yesterday, the web is fleeting.</p>

<p>Today's Facebook could be tomorrow's footnote.</p>

<p>And when whatever platform you're active on fades away, so will everything you've ever shared there.</p>

<p>That's no reason to stop creating, though. Putting your stuff out there creates a powerful impression.</p>

<p>But the only way to build a presence with true staying power is to establish a body of work independent of any one platform.</p>

<p>That's actually why I've spent the last few weeks archiving all my posts and coding my own site to host them all. (you're on it right now ðŸ˜‰)</p>

<p>Didn't do it because of yesterday's Zuck up, but it definitely makes me feel good about my decision.</p>

    <h1 >New year, new journey</h1>
    <p>As 2021 ended, so did my time at Atreo.</p>
    <p>Goodbyes are never easy. But in this case, it was particularly hard.</p>
    <p>In just two short years, I learnt so much and gained what feels like a lifetime of growth and experiences.</p>
    <p>From the incredible brands whose stories I helped write. To my wonderful team. To the transformational mentors and role-models I had the privilege of working alongside and learning immeasurably from.</p>
    <p>Words can&#39;t express the gratitude and appreciation I have looking back on my time at Atreo.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I&#39;m also looking forward to the tremendous opportunity up ahead.</p>
    <p>As of today, I begin a new journey as the Brand Director for a startup on a truly astounding growth trajectory.</p>
    <p>They&#39;re still in stealth, so there&#39;s not much more detail I can go into.</p>
    <p>But expect to hear a lot more, very soon.</p>
    <p>Onwards and upwards for 2022!</p>

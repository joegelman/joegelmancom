<h1>Everything is marketing</h1>
<p>Richard Sears was what many would claim to be, but few were: a true marketing genius.</p>

<p>One small, but perfect example. He knew that most households in the 1910’s would have both the Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Montgomery Ward catalogs in their homes. So, what did he do?</p>

<p>Sears made sure his catalog was printed just a bit less wide and less tall. Why?</p>

<p>Because he knew that when people were tidying up their homes, they would naturally place Sears’ slightly more compact catalog on top of the competition.</p>

<p>Literally brand positioning. Pure marketing genius.</p>

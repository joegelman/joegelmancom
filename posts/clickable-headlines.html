<h1>What are the last 3 headlines you clicked on?
</h1>

<p>Chances are pretty good you don’t remember.</p>

<p>Now, why is that?</p>

<p>Here’s a theory: remembering is a conscious process. But the headlines that pulled you never even made it to the conscious brain.</p>

<p>So here’s some homework: go into your history (or maybe just flip through your open tabs) and try to fill in the blanks. Find out which headlines you clicked last.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself, “why these?” Think what it was about these headlines in particular that grabbed you.</p>

<p>Guarantee there’s a lesson or two lurking in there you can start putting into practice today.</p>

<p>Headline lesson #5: figure out what makes you click, and you’ll be able to apply that in your work</p>

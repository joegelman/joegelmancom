    <h1 id="-in-visibility-and-control-">(In)visibility and control.</h1>
<p>In cyber, &quot;visibility and control&quot; is the go-to benefit. It&#39;s everywhere. And at this point, it&#39;s just noise.</p>
<p>Not because &quot;visibility and control&quot; isn&#39;t what security pros are looking for. It totally is. The problem is, it&#39;s almost too true.</p>
<p>It&#39;s kind of like restaurants that advertise, &quot;delicious food&quot;, or airlines that promote &quot;safe, fast travel&quot;. Like yes, those are something that every customer out there wants. But they&#39;re table stakes. Totally undifferentiated.</p>
<p>Same goes for cyber.</p>
<p>Try to think of what cyber company the benefit of &quot;visibility and control&quot; <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> apply to...</p>
<p>Yeah, I couldn&#39;t think of any either.</p>
<p>What makes it harder is that so many in the industry do fall back on this default message. So anyone trying to make the same claim simply gets cancelled out in the static.</p>
<p>I think the real trick is to ladder one step up, and ask &quot;what do they get from the specific type of visibility and control you give?&quot;.</p>
<p>To port the analogy over to the restaurant industry, maybe it&#39;s &quot;come share a great meal, with great friends.&quot; Or for airlines &quot;Fast flexible bookings: because real business happens in person&quot;. Not winning any Gold Lions, but there&#39;s a definite uplift in even these crude examples.</p>
<p>Cyber could definitely benefit from a similar treatment.</p>
<p>Long story short, to take control of your narrative, and ensure visibility -- elevate the generic benefit one level higher.</p>

<p>Who was the first person to walk on the moon?</p>
<p>Neil Armstrong. Easy.</p>
<p>Second person?</p>
<p>Buzz Aldrin. Not so easy.</p>
<p>This is the first immutable law of marketing in action:</p>
<p>It’s better to be first than to be better.</p>
<p>Because your position in the market (and more importantly, in your prospect’s mind) is exactly like the moon men example.</p>
<p>Armstrong is first, he’s well-known. Then maybe a few know second place Buzz. But then who the hell knows who Pete Conrad is? (Hint: he’s the third guy)</p>
<p>Same way with the market for anything. iPhone is first. Then maybe Samsung. Then an anonymous blur of identical also-rans. First is Tesla. Then comes everyone else. And so on…</p>
<p>Being there first, and being perceived as first, isn’t the only way to win. But it’s as sure a way to win as any.</p>
<p>*PS This is the first in a loose series I’m going to do condensing Ries and Trout’s 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. I’ll post whenever I can’t think of anything else to post. So this might take a while.</p>

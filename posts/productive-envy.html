    <h1 id="productive-envy">Productive envy</h1>
<p>Every year, Bloomberg publishes something they call the “Jealousy
List”.</p>
<p>They go around to all the staff writers, and ask them to choose one
piece from a different publication they wish they’d written.</p>
<p>It’s a refreshingly humbling exercise, and also a productive one.</p>
<p>Recognizing the skill of others in your field without ill will gives
you something to aim for. And powerful motivation to improve.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with peers doing work that astounds you (that you
feel goes far beyond your current ability), and you’ll find that the
mere act of being in awe will fast-track your own development.</p>
<p>And before you know it, your work might be the one ending up on
someone else’s list.</p>
<p>PS - Just want to give a shoutout to my insanely talented mentor and
friend, Ari Yablok for the launch of the <a href="https://www.island.io" target="blank">Island</a> brand. It’s shot straight to the top of my list
for sure.</p>

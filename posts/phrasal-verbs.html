<h1>Phrasal verbs + rhetorical tricks = copy magic</h1>
<p>So what are phrasal verbs? These are special pairs of verbs and prepositions (or adverbs) that come together to create a whole new meaning.</p>

<strong>For example:</strong>
<p><em>“Give” </em>means one thing. <em>“Give into”</em> means a very different thing. <em>“Give off”</em> means something else entirely. etc...</p>

<p>These idiomatic meanings are super common*, and already make for great conversational copywriting.</p>

<p>But the rhetorically minded among you might see an added opportunity.</p>

<p>Because many different phrasal verbs can all start with the same word, that gives us a chance to pull off some effortless anaphora.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<em>“When you can't come up with copy, phrasal verbs come through.”</em>

<p>And since most end with a limited number of prepositions, epistrophe also comes easy.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<em>“Got writers block? Either deal with it, or live with it.”</em>

<p>Prepositions also have the bonus of coming in pairs of opposites, making for some natural antithesis.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>

<em>“Tune in, drop out.”</em>

<p>The potential here is crazy. And so much great copy just leverages it instinctively.</p>

<p>I’m telling you. Start watching out for this stuff, and you’ll start seeing it everywhere.</p>

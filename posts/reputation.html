    <h1 id="reputation-is-priceless">Reputation is priceless</h1>
    <p>In a world where multi-billion dollar valuations have become a dime a dozen, there’s still one thing money can’t buy.</p>
    <p>It’s the right person or institution, with the right reputation putting their seal of approval on that thing you’ve built. </p>
    <p>I’m not talking about a #sponsored post, or some throwaway line in press-release no one will ever read. I’m taking the kind of authentic, all-in embrace that no one out there can fake. </p>
    <p>Whether it’s something as formal as attaching their name to a board or funding round. Or it’s something as informal as talking a product, or idea to other influential friends at some dinner party or conference. </p>
    <p>Just about everything’s been monetized and price-tagged these days. That’s what makes reputation all the more priceless.</p>
    <p>If you can find the reputations you want in your corner, and get creative with winning them over, you’ll find your own reputation vaulted higher than you thought possible. </p>
    <p>And by its very definition, all of this will be free.</p>

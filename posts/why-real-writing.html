<p>In the world of marketing, a lot of words are written that can&#39;t really be counted as writing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s more like strategically sprinkling a page with keywords, then surrounding them with inane, inoffensive jargon.</p>
<p>What&#39;s meant to happen is that the 90% fluff pads the 10% keywords. So you don&#39;t have to resort to literally sending prospects a naked list of bullet points (though that would probably be preferable, and save everyone a whole lot of time).</p>
<p>Whatever this is, it&#39;s not real writing.</p>
<p>Real writing&#39;s way less safe. Instead of providing cushion between scannable buzzwords, it pulls the reader in and actually challenges and engages them.</p>
<p>Real writing isn&#39;t written to be ignored. It demands attention. Creates its own inescapable gravity.</p>
<p>When rushed or botched, attempts at real writing do worse than &quot;keyword stuffing.&quot; The ceiling is way higher, but the floor is way lower.</p>
<p>And real writing is hard, so it&#39;s no wonder that most opt for the safe alternative. They build whole marketing operations around this kind of writing. They come to expect it. They bore their customers to tears.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m here to ask that any marketer reading this who feels a shard of truth jabbing their side, go out and champion for a bolder truer alternative.</p>
<p>Marketers of the world, make 2022 the year you give real writing a chance.</p>

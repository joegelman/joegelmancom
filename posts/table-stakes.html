    <h1>Today’s above-and-beyond is tomorrow’s table stakes</h1>
    <p>Used to be a company Christmas party was all the company “culture” you needed</p>
    <p>Now if you don’t have a whole “employee wellness” department you’re basically a hollering band of savages</p>
    <p>Used to be design was pretty decoration you sprinkled on top of whatever else it was you were doing</p>
    <p>Now design thinking is demanded at the highest level, all the way down to the smallest details — and yes, people are paying attention, and they can tell the difference</p>
    <p>Used to be all you had to do was be a bit better/cheaper/smarter than the competition</p>
    <p>Now you’ve got to position yourself in a game-changing way, otherwise you’ll drown in a sea of sameness</p>
    <p>When you’re setting up your targets, make sure you’re not just catching up with what used to be the standard, and actually aiming beyond what will be mere table stakes tomorrow</p>

<h1>Metrics don’t measure everything</h1>
<p>Was talking to someone last night, and they said they liked my posts. I didn’t remember seeing their likes.</p>

<p>They answered: “Oh, well I don’t actually click ‘like’ very often. I just enjoy reading them whenever they pop up in my feed.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I know for a fact that some people just click like on everything in sight. My posts included.</p>

<p>Now, of course I’d rather have the genuine “non-like” over the shallow “like” any day of the week.</p>

<p>But if I only measured the metrics, I’d be optimizing for those who actually clicked. Meanwhile, the real silent fans would be getting left out.</p>

<p>The question then becomes, how do you get an accurate read on what people really like?</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, and are one of those people who likes without hitting the button, please let me know. Not because I care about the metrics (I don’t at all). But because I want to find out what you truly enjoy, and give you more of it.</p>

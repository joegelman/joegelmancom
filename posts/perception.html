    <p>If there’s one thing that sinks marketers, it’s the delusion that they’re dealing in the world of objective facts. </p>
    <p>That if only their product is 26% better, then everyone will realize and react accordingly.</p>
    <p>The truth, of course, is that this is not how the world works, and this is not how the market behaves. </p>
    <p>People color their entire worldview through the lens of their own preferences, prejudices and preconceptions.</p>
    <p>Take the Super Bowl for example.</p>
    <p>For years, it was considered the hottest advertising commodity, because you knew that nearly every American was going to at least be somewhat interested or engaged by it.</p>
    <p>Well, slowly, slowly, times have changed. And so has the perceptions surrounding the event. </p>
    <p>This year, a meme that had been brewing for a while absolutely took off. </p>
    <p>The Superb Owl movement.</p>
    <p>Pictures of excellent owls everywhere.</p>
    <p>Same exact letters. Totally different perceptions.</p>
    <p>Next time you catch yourself believing in objective facts, just remember that where some people see game day, others see excellent owls.</p>

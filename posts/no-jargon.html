<p>In some industries, jargon might make people feel safe. Like whoever they&#39;re buying from is a real, big-boy, &quot;legit&quot; company.</p>
<p>But puffy buzzwords that everyone&#39;s saying aren&#39;t actually impressing anyone. And since they&#39;re already all agreed upon by their nature, they wind up melding whoever uses them into the same homogeneous corporate sludge.</p>
<p>Sometimes particularly conservative buyers in particularly conservative markets might feel safer buying sludge guaranteed not to kill them than some unknown entity.</p>
<p>But the one thing every single buyer will prefer every single time is pure refined truth, that&#39;s crystal clear, precise and refreshingly different.</p>
<p>Except that&#39;s way harder than just regurgitating Gartner.</p>

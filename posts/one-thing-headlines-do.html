<h1>The one thing all great headlines do…
</h1>

<p>They only talk about one thing!</p>

<p>Brains are lazy. Too many ideas and they’ll tune you out entirely.</p>

<p>New rule I just made up: You’re writing’s gotta focus ten times harder than you want your reader to focus.</p>

<p>So get relentless about cutting all the “well maybe we should talk about this?” Or the “oh, well it’s important we also mention that?”</p>

<p>NO.</p>

<p>As the famous saying goes—kill your darlings. But don’t stop there. Also kill your PMM’s darlings, and Sue from accounting’s darlings.</p>

<p>Not because you’re a bad person and you enjoy watching Sue suffer.</p>

<p>But because you know that whatever she wants to shoehorn into your writing pulls focus away from the one thing it’s trying to say.</p>

<p>The one thing you’re trying to do with your writing at all.</p>

<p>Grab a reader’s attention long enough to put an idea inside their mind.</p>

<p>Headline Rule #4: Focus on one thing, or they’ll read nothing.</p>

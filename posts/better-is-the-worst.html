<h1>Better is the worst</h1>

<p>The word better is everywhere, and it’s such a weak choice.</p>

<p>First off, it’s kind of a weak idea to begin with. You’re not actually saying anything, just making a general, subjective, floating-point comparison.</p>

<p>Speaking of, the fact that you need to compare it to something for it to work means you’ve got to bring up competing ideas just to use it.</p>

<p>And, worst of all, the word better has simply been done to death. Who on earth doesn’t believe they’re better? It’s something that’s practically implied by the very act of marketing/copywriting/advertising, etc...</p>

<p>So, to conclude my rant: If you ever feel the urge to use it, I’d say you’re better off not.</p>

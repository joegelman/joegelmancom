<p>Legendary designer Paul Rand was famous for his dramatic presentation.</p>

<p>When he created the NeXT logo for Steve Jobs, the meticulous, careful explanation of all his thought processes and choices were what sold the design.</p>

<p>Because Rand understood something every creative must realize. Even the greatest work will never recover from poor presentation.</p>

<p>Putting so much thought and care into the craft, only to ship it to the client as an anonymous email attachment is a crying shame.</p>

<p>Get smarter about how you share your work, and you’ll be shocked at the difference it makes.</p>

    <h1>You’ve gotta go tour the factory.</h1>
    <p>Another OG MadMan story, this time from the father of the USP himself, Rosser Reeves. </p>
    <p>Legend has it that when Reeves was looking for the USP for M&amp;M’s, he refused to simply sit in his office and think. He insisted on going out and touring the factory itself.</p>
    <p>While there, one of the workers scooped a bunch of M&amp;M’s straight off the conveyor belt and offered them to Reeves. The worker was sweating bullets, but the M&amp;M’s didn’t melt a bit. </p>
    <p>Reeves was surprised, and asked what the secret was. The reply, “Oh, M&amp;M’s are the only sugar-coated candy made. So they only melt when you eat ‘em.”</p>
    <p>Just like that, inspiration struck.</p>
    <p>To this day, the tagline he wrote “M&amp;M’s: Melts in your mouth, not in your hands.” Is consistently rated the greatest of all time.</p>
    <p>When interviewed about it many years later, Reeves explained “Perhaps it could’ve been phrased 15 different ways, but the idea for the campaign was obvious once I saw it. It was inherent in the product.”</p>
    <p>Great copywriting does not happen behind a desk, or inside an ivory tower.</p>
    <p>If you really want to find those brilliant hooks, you’ve gotta go straight to the source.</p>
    <p>When you finally do, you’ll realize they’re right there, clear as day, just waiting for you to find them.</p>

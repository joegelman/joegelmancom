    <h1 id="there-s-a-reason-that-by-the-book-only-happens-in-the-book-">There’s a reason that by the book only happens in the book.</h1>
<p>Because in the real world, the market’s only a year old and it’s already an absolute dogfight. Because the timeline is impossible. Because everyone’s availability (especially these days) is a total crapshoot.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know this isn&#39;t the way you’re supposed to do it. But if you only did things the way you’re supposed to, you just wouldn’t do things.</p>
<p>So what <em>do</em> you do? You power through. You remember what by the book looks like, so you can try and pull your crazy process towards it as much as possible. What you don’t do is fold your arms and refuse to move forward because things aren’t perfectly in accordance with theory.</p>
<p>Following the book will only get you so far. To truly go places, you’ve got to write your own way.</p>

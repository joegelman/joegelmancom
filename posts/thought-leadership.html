<h1>How to do thought leadership (without sounding like an asshole)
</h1>
<p>1. Don’t talk about yourself</p>

<p>No one cares about what you’re thinking, doing, etc… they only care about how your ideas help them get better. Shift the focus away from you, and let your thoughts do the leadership.</p>

<p>2. Stop trying to be profound</p>

<p>This is not the TED stage or the UN General Assembly. It’s LinkedIn, and people won’t spend longer than 12 seconds reading anything. Be snappy, punchy, and stay hyper-focused instead of grandiose.</p>

<p>3. No shilling for your employer/business</p>

<p>We can see right through you. And we’re not interested.<p></p>

<p>4. Only post when you have something to say</p>

<p>Then just say it, and get on with your day.</p>

<p>On that note</p>

<p>👊🏻</p>

<p>🎤</p>

    <h1>They always say “write like you speak.”</h1>
    <p>But when most writers sit down to write, what do they do? They sit in silence.</p>
    <p>You’ll never be able to follow the (damn good) advice of “write like you speak” unless you’re constantly out and about, engaging, talking and listening about the subject you’re trying to capture. </p>
    <p>If all you do is read what other people write, then re-read what you wrote back to yourself, the end product will never flow naturally. It’ll sound exactly like the process that created it. Stiff, deliberate, and overthought.</p>
    <p>In short, the number one guaranteed way to “write like you speak”, is to go out there and start saying more things.</p>

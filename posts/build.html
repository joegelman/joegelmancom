<p>Not sure how to get started? Get ambitious and make something.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t spend time planning. Or brainstorming. Or scrolling for &quot;inspo.&quot;</p>
<p>These are all things that will tighten the grip doubt holds on you. It&#39;ll feel like movement, but it&#39;ll actually be like struggling against quicksand. You&#39;ll sink deeper, and deeper.</p>
<p>The only way out is to create. Something. Anything. Get all the bad ideas out, so the good ones have room to flow.</p>
<p>Build beyond your comfort zone. Because honestly, right now, your comfort zone is a dead end.</p>
<p>Doing creative work, self-doubt, and writer&#39;s block, and all the other names for that lack of inner fire are going to be unavoidable. But when they do present themselves, just remember that the only way out is to build your way up.</p>

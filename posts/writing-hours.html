    <h1>How many hours do you write a day?</h1>
    <p>I&#39;m working my way through the Masterclass by ad legends Goodby and Silverstein (of &quot;Got Milk?&quot; fame), and came across a nice little nugget of wisdom.</p>
    <p>Goodby shares the story of being a junior copywriter and getting the chance to meet the OG Madman himself, David Ogilvy.</p>
    <p>Between chain-smoked cigarettes Ogilvy asked, &quot;So, kid. How many hours you write a day?&quot;</p>
    <p>Not knowing the answer, and not wanting to sound like an amateur, Goodby lied and said &quot;10 hours a day. Every day.&quot;</p>
    <p>Ogilvy shot back. &quot;That&#39;s all wrong. I never have time to write more than 2 hours a day. I&#39;m spending the rest of my time thinking what to write about.&quot;</p>
    <p>This is so spot on. </p>
    <p>Most of the job of writing is actually observing. Taking it all in. Being constantly alert to discover what&#39;s actually interesting out there.</p>
    <p>The lesson here is simple, but powerful.</p>
    <p>Figure out your world first. Then write the words.</p>
